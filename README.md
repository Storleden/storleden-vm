    This means your vagrant machine boot fine, if you don't see this message read the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting 'troubleshooting') below.

* To administer you machine you can go ssh it with `vagrant ssh`

## Troubleshooting

Commun errors.

* SSH command responded with a non-zero message.

    If you see this message:

    >     The SSH command responded with a non-zero exit status. Vagrant
    >     assumes that this means the command failed. The output for this command
    >     should be in the log above. Please read the output to determine what
    >     went wrong.

    This might happen because the folder didn't mount properly. To fix this run `vagrant reload --provision`

* Vagrant hang out.

    Vagrant machine never start. @docu needed here.
